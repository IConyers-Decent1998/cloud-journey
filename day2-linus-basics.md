Basic Linus Commands
Case sensitive:
pwd --->  Where am I? ( In the directory of course.)
ls ---> List files (A list of created files or list of files in directory.) 
cd ---> Change folders (Move to a different folder) 
mkdir ---> Makes a folder (Self explained but not to be confused with the next command) 
touch ---> Create a file (Not a folder) 
rm ---> Delete file (Use slow and steady you could possibly delete something important)
clear ---> Clears command prompts, I do believe at the moment that this puts you back to the beginning taking you out of any folder you are currently in. 
rm - r ---> Deletes a directory from what I know it may be the same as rm but I made a new directory playing around a bit and it wouldnt let me delete it while in it, but this may or may not be the same as rm I might just be a noob.
Attempting to go off the rails a bit and not follow Chat GPT was a little confusing trying to make files and a directory and them remove them without Chat Gpt but at this point I do really wanna remember things I can do without looking for help but thats ovbiously not feesable its only day 3! so far so good loving the process.
