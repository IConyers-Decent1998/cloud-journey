I've learned in a couple youtube videos none being longer than 10 minutes about the internet. 
The Internet isnt just some big cloud of air and wireless internet. The internet is for lack of better words a line/ Cord or wire underground where servers and or websites link you to them.
Example: Me typing on visual studio code. my computer is sending packets through the internet at light speeds(or close to) to a server that has visual studio codes imformation or packets on it. the server is then responding with codes i dont exactly remember all of them but I think the most imporatant ones are 200 codes and 400 codes.
200 codes are accepted codes, working codes.
400 codes are error codes meaning the server may not have the packets your computer is requesting or you may not even be connected to the internet
WWW- World Wide Web
Countries connect through fiber cables these cables are physical cables that are litterally laid in the ocean from country to country connecting servers and internet
The cloud is just large places throughout that hold imformation making it easier for companies to house imformation, you access the internet and servers via a "client" 
Http- Hyper Text Transpher Protocol
Client(your computer)-- Router (does the talking /the mediateor)-- Server(holds files and imformation sends back response to router and to the client and so on n so forth) 
Cloud computing A large and expensive cluster of computers made up of 3 things SaaS(The software) PaaS (Platform as a service) IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)  (this is after going back and watching the video again) 
CLoud computing allows the website to hold data for your client or computer/tower to save space or your computer would be overrun with memory.
