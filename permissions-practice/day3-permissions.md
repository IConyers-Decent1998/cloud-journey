Today I learned what "r,w,x" means
"r"" means read or capabilities to see the file or directory. "r" is also 4 points
"w" means write or edit capabilities. "w" is also 2 points
"x" means exectute. "x" is also 1 point
What does "chmod +x" do? To break it down a bit, x means execute and + means to add. chom means to changes permissions so in all it means: Change permissions add execute to "File Name"
On thing that suprised me is how meticulous you need to be when reading these commands and writing these commands. It's easy to get confused being new and one wrong move sends you down a rabbit hole of questions. Makes for faster learning. I will count it as a blessing.
