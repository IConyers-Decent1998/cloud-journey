So today I learned how to do a python script. At first I thought I'd only be using Gitbash but its seems for automations I used a combination of the three programs (Visual Studio Code, Gitbash, and python).
Without PATH this would'nt have been easily achieved I would've had to manually type the path for these functions to work but path automatically find the "PATH" it needs to go to complete tasks and overall do the animations
One thing that suprised me is how simple automations are currently. This is only day 5 for me so things could get a complicated reguarding this very soon!
The year just turned 4 days ago and the year of 2026 I don't need everything to fall into place nor do I need to have my way in all situations.
This year I pray for consistency in all that I do Family,Gym,Work you name it.
I don't one wonderful week or month will get me where I want with any of these things expecially coding/Dev-ops/ ETC.!! 
I do know consistency throughout the year can though so day 5 and heres to consistency!
